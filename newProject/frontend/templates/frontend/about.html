              <div class="dividerAbout"></div>

              <p class="aboutPara mt-3">
                Purple Housing was created to make finding off-campus housing easier for TCU students. The creator of purple housing, a TCU student himself, recognized that TCU students didn’t have an easy or efficient way to find off campus housing. It either involved driving around and calling off of rent signs or looking on Zillow and finding out that the house were available now, not for the June-August lease start dates that students start looking for as early as September.
              </p>

              <p class="aboutPara">
                Purple Housing has the most options of tcu area rental properties because we work with local landlords, property management companies, and apartments to notify the students of their properties’ availability. We have helped hundreds of TCU students find the perfect house and we look forward to doing the same for you.
